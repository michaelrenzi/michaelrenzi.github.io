    <p>Test In my most recent positions, I worked for the Web Services team at Georgetown University as a Web Project Manager as well for the Georgetown University Initiative on Innovation, Development and Evaluation (<a href="https://gui2de.georgetown.edu/"><em>gui</em><sup>2</sup><em>de</em>)</a> as a Research Assistant. In both of these positions, I have learned the importance of the ability to soundly translate and present technical specifications in order to steer operations in a practical and effective manner.</p>
    <p>I am a steadfast proponent of the utiliziation of data and statistical analysis in all natures of creative problem-solving, from development projects designed to improve livelihoods in the third world to moneyball analytics in the MLB. I am a self-starter and a fast learner, and look forward to new challenges and lessons as they arise in the ever-evolving sectors of information technology and data science.</p>
    <p>My passions and skills include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Project Management</li>
      <li>Statistical Analysis</li>
      <li>Data Visualization</li>
      <li>User Experience Design</li>
      <li>Training and Documentation Development</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In my free time, I am an avid fan of all DC sports (often to my demise), a foodie in search of new recipes and culinary trends, and a travel-enthusiast (/possible travel agent in a former life) who loves planning multi-destination international trips.</p>
